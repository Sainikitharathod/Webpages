            <p>The Smart City project is a web-based application for storing all the essential information
                about a city. Cities and urban areas are witnessing a massive influx of people from all corners seeking
                employment, education and even a better lifestyle.
                The main intension and purpose of our project is to help the new comers of the city to know the
                information and system about various aspects of the city.</p>

             <p>A vehicular cloud (VC) is a network of vehicles that perform cooperative computing through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Existing research on vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is mostly based on cloud servers or edge servers, not VCs.Existing research on vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is mostly based on cloud servers or edge servers, not VCs.
            Previously,  a scheduling scheme  is proposed which runs on vehicular cloud or edge cloud.
            It was a genetic algorithm based scheduling method with low complexity considering task dependency for the optimization. In this project, we propose a cooperative computing method based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. 
            We use Stepwise Computation Offloading for Cost-efficient Cooperation (SCOCC) to form a vehicular cloud and find an energy-efficient task schedule.</p>
